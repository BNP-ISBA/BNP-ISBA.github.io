    <b>Density regression via Dirichlet process mixtures of normal structured additive regression models</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Within Bayesian nonparametrics, dependent Dirichlet process mixture models provide a flexible approach for conducting
inference about the conditional density function. However, several formulations of this class make either restrictive
modelling assumptions or involve intricate algorithms for posterior inference. We propose a flexible and computationally
convenient approach for density regression based on a single-weights dependent Dirichlet process mixture of normal
distributions model for univariate continuous responses. We assume an additive structure for the mean of each mixture
component and incorporate the effects of continuous covariates through smooth functions. The key components of our
modelling approach are penalised B-splines and their bivariate tensor product extension. Our method also seamlessly
accommodates categorical covariates, linear effects of continuous covariates, varying coefficient terms, and random
effects, which is why we refer our model as a Dirichlet process mixture of normal structured additive regression models. A
notable feature of our method is the simplicity of posterior simulation using Gibbs sampling, as closed-form full conditional
distributions for all model parameters are available. Results from a simulation study demonstrate that our approach
successfully recovers the true conditional densities and other regression functionals in challenging scenarios. Applications
to three real datasets further underpin the broad applicability of our method.

        An R package, DDPstar, implementing the proposed method is available at CRAN(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DDPstar/index.html).
