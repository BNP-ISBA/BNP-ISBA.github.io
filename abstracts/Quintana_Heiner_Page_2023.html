    <b>A Projection Approach to Local Regression with Variable-Dimension Covariates</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Incomplete covariate vectors are known to be problematic for estimation and inferences
on model parameters, but their impact on prediction performance is less understood. We
develop an imputation-free method that builds on a random partition model admitting
variable-dimension covariates. Cluster-specific response models further incorporate covariates
via linear predictors, facilitating estimation of smooth prediction surfaces with relatively few
clusters. Component kernels exploit marginalization techniques to analytically project response
distributions according to any pattern of missing covariates, yielding a local regression with
internally consistent uncertainty propagation that utilizes only one set of coefficients per
cluster. Aggressive shrinkage of these coefficients regulates uncertainty due to missing covariates.
The method allows in- and out-of-sample prediction for any missingness pattern, even if the
pattern in a new subject's incomplete covariate vector was not seen in the training data. We
develop an MCMC algorithm for posterior sampling that improves a computationally expensive
update for latent cluster allocation. Finally, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness for
nonlinear point and density prediction under various circumstances by comparing with other
recent methods for regression of variable dimensions on synthetic and real data.
